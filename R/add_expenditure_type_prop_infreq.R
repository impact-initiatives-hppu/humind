#' @title Add Infrequent Expenditure Type Proportions
#'
#' @description
#' This function calculates the proportion of each infrequent expenditure type
#' relative to the total infrequent expenditure. It adds new columns to the input
#' data frame representing these proportions.
#'
#' Prerequisite function:
#'
#' * add_expenditure_type_zero_infreq.R
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing infrequent expenditure data.
#' @param cm_expenditure_infrequent_shelter Column name for shelter maintenance or repair expenditure amount.
#' @param cm_expenditure_infrequent_nfi Column containing expenditure amount for non-food household items for infrequent purchase, such as blankets, cooking pots, clothing, etc.
#' @param cm_expenditure_infrequent_health Column name for health-related expenditures, such as healthcare, medicine, etc.
#' @param cm_expenditure_infrequent_education Column name for education-related expenditures, such school fees, supplies, uniforms, etc.
#' @param cm_expenditure_infrequent_debt Column containing expenditure amount for debt repayment.
#' @param cm_expenditure_infrequent_clothing Column containing expenditure amount for clothing.
#' @param cm_expenditure_infrequent_other Column name for all other infrequent expenditures.
#'
#' @return A data frame with additional columns:
#'
#' * cm_expenditure_infrequent_total: The total infrequent expenditure amount.
#' * cm_expenditure_infrequent_shelter_prop: Proportion of shelter maintenance or repair expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_infrequent_nfi_prop: Proportion of non-food household items expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_infrequent_health_prop: Proportion of health-related expenditures.
#' * cm_expenditure_infrequent_education_prop: Proportion of education-related expenditures.
#' * cm_expenditure_infrequent_debt_prop: Proportion of debt repayment expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_infrequent_clothing_prop: Proportion of clothing-related expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_infrequent_other_prop: Proportion of other infrequent expenditures.
