# humind (development version)

# humind 2025.1.3

## üõ† Codebase Changes

### üõ† Bug Fixes

* Protection: respect the `sep` argument when constructing choice-column names in `add_prot_score_practices()` and `add_prot_score_rights()`. Both `/` (default) and `.` separators are supported. Tests updated; no breaking changes.

# humind 2025.1.2

This release introduces major terminology and logic changes across the MSNI framework, WASH, Protection, and Healthcare indicators. Several functions have new required parameters, altered defaults, or renamed outputs ‚Äî **breaking changes are significant**.

---

## üìñ 2025 Programmatic Changes

* **Terminology Migration**  
  All references to *acute need* are migrated to **severe need**, in line with 2025 guidance.  
  - Function `is_in_acute_need()` is now **`is_in_severe_need()`**.  
  - All composite outputs renamed from `*_in_acute_need` ‚Üí **`*_in_severe_need`** across MSNI, WASH, Health, Food Security, SNFI, Education, and Protection.

* **WASH (Handwashing Facilities)**  
  - Expanded logic in `add_handwashing_facility_cat()` to incorporate **soap type** (qualifying vs non-qualifying).  
  - Harmonized observed vs reported classification rules.  
  - Stricter handling of NA values (reported ‚Äúyes‚Äù with NA ‚Üí now ‚Äúlimited‚Äù).  

* **Healthcare**  
  - `add_loop_healthcare_needed_cat()` improved to propagate NA correctly and issue explicit warnings.  

* **Protection**  
  - `add_prot_score_rights()` and `add_prot_score_practices()` reworked NA handling: DNK/PNTA now nullifies **sub-scores** rather than collapsing the entire composite.  
  - Added diagnostics and warnings for transparency.  

---

## üõ† Codebase Changes

### üöÄ New Features
* **WASH**:  
  - Soap-type support in `add_handwashing_facility_cat()`.  
  - Vectorized handling of ‚Äúno‚Äù codes for water/soap inputs.  
* **Protection**:  
  - Warnings when sub-dimension scores are NA.  
  - More robust NA handling in rights and practices composites.  
* **Healthcare**:  
  - Warning when `needed == yes` and `received == NA`.  

---

### üîÑ Enhancements
* Harmonized observed/reported classification trees for handwashing facilities.  
* Row-wise composite score computation for protection.  
* More explicit documentation of function arguments and classification logic.  

---

### üõ† Bug Fixes
* Corrected misclassification in reported handwashing facilities where NA water/soap previously returned NA instead of ‚Äúlimited.‚Äù  
* Fixed inconsistent handling of vector ‚Äúno‚Äù codes in handwashing classification.  
* Corrected logic in protection composites to avoid premature collapse to NA.  

---

### üß™ Testing
* Exhaustive test grids added for handwashing classification (soap-type handling, scalar vs vector inputs).  
* Regression tests ensure new NA/warning behaviors in protection and healthcare are validated.  
* Expanded unit tests for new ‚Äúsevere need‚Äù naming.  

---

### üìö Documentation
* Updated all function documentation to reflect ‚Äúsevere‚Äù terminology.  
* Added detailed decision tree explanation for handwashing facility classification.  
* Clarified parameter defaults for composite functions.  

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

* **Renames**
  - `is_in_acute_need()` ‚Üí **`is_in_severe_need()`**.  
  - Output columns: all `*_in_acute_need` ‚Üí **`*_in_severe_need`**.  

* **WASH**
  - `add_comp_wash()` default parameter for `drinking_water_quantity` now **`wash_hwise_drink`** (was `wash_drinking_water_quantity`).  
  - `add_handwashing_facility_cat()` requires new **soap type** columns/args and accepts vectorized ‚Äúno‚Äù codes.  
  - Classification rules: soap type can **demote `basic` ‚Üí `limited`**, and NA handling has changed.  

* **Protection**
  - DNK/PNTA handling refined: only sub-dimensions become NA; composites NA only if **both** subs are NA.  

* **Healthcare**
  - `add_loop_healthcare_needed_cat()` now returns NA with warnings when `needed == yes` and `received == NA`.

# humind 2025.1.1

This release introduces major updates across protection indicators, SNFI and
shelter categorization, expenditure scoring, testing framework improvements,
dependency management, and documentation. Deprecated WGQ components are fully
removed.

---

## üìñ 2025 Programmatic Changes

* **Protection**: complete ravamp, based on a series of new Tier 1 indicators
related to Protection Needs. 

* **SNFI**:
  * Changes to the number of shelter issues and their mapping to the FW (from 8
  to 11 total issues).
  * Inclusion of one additional indicator to the security of tenure dimension:
  `hlp_eviction_risk.`
  * Hygiene indicator removed from the FDS series - making the total number of
  domestic tasks (and lighting) equal to 4 instead of 5.
  * Optional shelter damages component added.


* **Health**: removal of the WGQs from the framework.

* **WASH**: small changes to incorporate the self-reported hygiene variants (availability of soap & water) and map them to the JMP classifications.

* **Food Security**: new additional step to analyze the impact of livelihood coping
strategies on Food Consumption (changes done in [impactR4PHU](https://github.com/impact-initiatives/impactR4PHU)
and reflected in humind).

* **Education**: small changes to indicator naming to reflect "direct attack on
education". Indicator name was `edu_disrupted_occupation` and is now called
`edu_disrupted_attack.` `edu_disrupted_occupation` and is now called
`edu_disrupted_attack.`

## üõ† Codebase Changes

### üöÄ New Features

  * Revised `add_shelter_issue_cat()` logic for better category handling and
  alignment with 2025 specifications.
  * Updated `add_comp_snfi()` for consistent categorization and explicit
  handling of special cases.
* **Expenditure Indicators**
  * Enhanced infrequent expenditure categorization functions and ranking logic.
* **Data Integrity**
  * Composition functions now preserve original data instead of overwriting
  with intermediate steps.

---

### üõ† Bug Fixes

* Fixed improper handling of invalid inputs in multiple test cases.
* Addressed warnings triggered by implicit handling of `max()` with all-NA vectors.

---

### üß™ Testing

* Adopted `testthat` best practices across test suites.
* Expanded unit tests for:
  * Protection composite framework
  * Shelter and occupancy categorization
  * Expenditure ranking

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

* Fully removed WGQ-related components and associated tests.
* Deleted obsolete function `add_child_sep_cat.R`.

# humind 2024.1.4

This release covers bug fixes, documentation updates, changes to parameters, and additional enhancements:

 - Documentation updates to better describe function purpose, outputs, and prerequisite functions. 
 - Functions no lover use _levels but instead use separate parameters. (#547)
 - `add_comp_wash()` per the MSNI framework, the function was updated for the urban categorization "basic which should be score 1 instead of score 2 (#558)
 - `add_comp_edu()` updates to show comp_edu_score_disrupted as 3 if displaced_n is greater than 0, instead of greater than 1.(#556)
 - `add_comp_health()` updated so that households with at least one person with a disability have the value 3 for comp_health_score (#550)
 - `add_loop_edu_ind_age_corrected()` updated to allow custom starting age for education analysis based on country-specific requirements (#549)
 - `add_comp_snfi()` now correctly categorizes "other"" for snfi_shelter_issue_cat (#545)
 - `add_loop_edu_ind_age_corrected()` function error message added for date formats not in the ISO 8601 format (#513)

# humind 2024.1.3

This release covers bug fixes.

 - `comp_edu_score_attendance()` now categorizes households correctly when children are not attending school and no protection issue was faced. (#532)
 - `add_shelter_issue_cat()` do not add -999 or -998 when the shelter issue is Don't know or Prefer not to answer (it keeps NAs) and "Other" is categorized as others and not undefined. (#534)
 - `add_comp_snfi()` default values were fixed in documentation. (#535)
 - `add_drinking_water_time_threshold_cat()`: corrected input parameters "under_30min" and "above_30min". (#539)
 - `add_comp_wash()`: corrected assigned severities for `comp_wash_score_sanitation` among HHs in camps. (#536)
 

# humind 2024.1.2

This release covers a hot patch, a new function, and enhancements.

- `add_sanitation_facility_jmp_cat()` now correctly handles the cases when the sanitation facility is improved and not shared (#522)
- A marvelous new function `add_quantile_interval()` now allows to add (weighted) quantile intervals columns for any numeric variables (#516), for instance for adding income quantiles.
- Some bug fixes for `add_loop_healthcare_needed_cat_to_main()` and 
`add_loop_edu_disrupted_d_to_main` when datasets do not name UUI columns "uuid" (#517).
- `add_age_cat()` has more intuitive breaks due to a fix and improvement of `num_cat()`. To be able to get the following thresholds: 0-17, 18-59, 60-119, 120+, you can write `add_age_cat("resp_age", breaks = c(0, 18, 60, 120))` (#504). Default breaks also changed to the aforementioned ones.
- If occupation by armed groups was not added in country due to relevancy, `add_loop_edu_disrupted_d()` and `add_loop_edu_disrupted_d_to_main()`, `occupation` can be set to NULL.


# humind 2024.1.1

This release covers mostly hot patches on a few bugs.

- For perceived protection risks, `add_comp_prot()` assigns the score of 1 to a severity level. (#514) 
- `add_msni()` now correctly handles metrics 3 and 4, adding a missing value when the household is not in need (#509, #510)
- `add_comp_wash` has some minor refinements. (#507)
- For total income, loans to friends and from assistance should not be considered. Function `add_income_source_prop()` now has these two parameters as `NULL` by default. It is still possible to include them. (#506)
