\description{
This function adds healthcare need categories to individual-level data, including disability information if provided. It creates dummy variables for different healthcare need scenarios and optionally includes disability-specific indicators.
Prerequisite function:
add_loop_wgq_ss.R - if WG-SS data collected

This function aggregates individual-level healthcare need data to the household level, including disability-specific information if provided.
