#' @title Add Zero for Skipped Infrequent Expenditure Types
#'
#' @description
#' This function adds zero values to infrequent expenditure types that were skipped in the survey.
#' Infrequent expenditures are defined as those with a 6-month recall period. The function also
#' ensures that when no expenditure is reported, all expenditure types are set to zero.
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing expenditure data.
#' @param expenditure_infreq A character string. The name of the column that contains the infrequent expenditures.
#' @param none The value for no expenditure.
#' @param undefined A character vector. The values that indicate that the infrequent expenditures type was skipped.
#' @param expenditure_infreq_types A character vector. The names of the columns that contain the amount of infrequent expenditures types.
#'
#' @return A data frame with updated expenditure columns: columns specified in expenditure_infreq_types are updated with zeros for skipped entries.
