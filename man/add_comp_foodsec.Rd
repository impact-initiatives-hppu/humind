A data frame with additional columns:
\itemize{
\item comp_foodsec_score: Food security composite score (1-5)

\item comp_foodsec_in_severe_need: Binary indicator for being in severe need of food security assistance
}
}
\description{
This function calculates a food security sectoral composite score based on
the food security phase. It assigns a score from 1 to 5 corresponding to
the food security phase, and determines if a household is in need or in
severe need of food security assistance.
