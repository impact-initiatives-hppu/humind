`humind` provides functions to compose usual humanitarian composite
indicators related to IMPACT Multi-Sector Needs Assessments (MSNAs). Such as:

- Specific indicators related to the MSNI framework: Sectoral Composites, MSNI Metrics and all recoding of indicators needed for these.
- Food security indicators (rCSI, LCSI, HHS, FCS).
- Recoding of WASH indicators to JMP classifications.

The package follows the 'Step - Composition' approach of IMPACT R framework.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of `humind` from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("impact-initiatives-hppu/humind@v2025.1.1")
```

To confirm that you have the correct version, you should try the following:

```r
packageVersion("humind")
# v2025.1.1
```

## 📚 Guidance Note

A comprehensive **Guidance Note** is available [here](https://acted.sharepoint.com/sites/IMPACT-Humanitarian_Planning_Prioritization/SitePages/MSNA%20analysis%20(LSG-MSNi).aspx?xsdata=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%3D%3D&sdata=UlNiOVVRdGoxSC9QYmg4SW1Hb1ppUmlCNi8wZ2xPMGZkdG8rYzcrU2ptND0%3D&ovuser=d200e903-19b0-452e-bd21-d1aa011390d5%2Cquentin.villotta%40impact-initiatives.org&OR=Teams-HL&CT=1753776647777&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNTA3MDMxODgwOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D) for all users of the `humind` package. This document provides essential background on the **MSNI framework** and includes sector-specific guidance.
Each sector includes a **"Humind Data Workflow"** section, guiding users through the necessary steps and highlighting the relevant `humind` package functions to use.

> ⚠️ **Users are strongly encouraged to thoroughly read this document** — particularly the *Data Workflow* sections — before starting any implementation work with Humind

> 📌 *Note: A more technical documentation guide will soon be available, detailing the full MSNI analysis workflow using `humind`, including runnable code examples. This guide will be directly integrated into the GitHub project to streamline the process.*

## 📖 2025 Programmatic Changes

* **Protection**: complete ravamp, based on a series of new Tier 1 indicators
related to Protection Needs. 

* **SNFI**:
  * Changes to the number of shelter issues and their mapping to the FW (from 8
  to 11 total issues).
  * Inclusion of one additional indicator to the security of tenure dimension:
  `hlp_eviction_risk.`
  * Hygiene indicator removed from the FDS series - making the total number of
  domestic tasks (and lighting) equal to 4 instead of 5.
  * Optional shelter damages component added.


* **Health**: removal of the WGQs from the framework.

* **WASH**: small changes to incorporate the self-reported hygiene variants (availability of soap & water) and map them to the JMP classifications.

* **Food Security**: new additional step to analyze the impact of livelihood coping
strategies on Food Consumption (changes done in [impactR4PHU](https://github.com/impact-initiatives/impactR4PHU)
and reflected in humind).

* **Education**: small changes to indicator naming to reflect "direct attack on
education". Indicator name was `edu_disrupted_occupation` and is now called
`edu_disrupted_attack.`

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### GitHub Credentials Error When Installing with devtools

When installing the package from GitHub using `devtools::install_github()`, you may encounter an error such as:

```r
> devtools::install_github("impact-initiatives-hppu/humind@v2025.1.1")

Using GitHub PAT from the git credential store.
Error : Failed to install 'unknown package' from GitHub:
  HTTP error 401.
  Bad credentials
```

This issue is typically caused by outdated or incorrect GitHub credentials stored in R. For public repositories, no credentials are required. To resolve this, you can either update your credentials or delete the stored credentials using the following commands:

```r
library(gitcreds)
gitcreds_delete()
```

After updating or deleting the credentials, retry the installation. This should resolve the error for public repositories.
