#' @title Add Frequent Expenditure Type Amount as Proportions of Total Frequent Expenditure
#'
#' @description
#' This function calculates the proportion of each frequent expenditure type
#' relative to the total frequent expenditure. It adds new columns to the input
#' data frame representing these proportions.
#'
#' Prerequisite function:
#'
#' * add_expenditure_type_zero_freq.R
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing frequent expenditure data.
#' @param cm_expenditure_frequent_food Column name for food items expenditure amount.
#' @param cm_expenditure_frequent_rent Column name for rent or shelter and/or land expenditure amount.
#' @param cm_expenditure_frequent_water Column name for water expenditure amount from all sources combined.
#' @param cm_expenditure_frequent_nfi Column name for non-food household items expenditure amount for regular purchase, such as hygiene items, lightbulbs, etc.
#' @param cm_expenditure_frequent_utilities Column name for utilities expenditure amount, such as electricity or gas connections, etc.
#' @param cm_expenditure_frequent_fuel Column name for fuel expenditure amount for cooking, for vehicles, etc.
#' @param cm_expenditure_frequent_transportation Column name for transportation expenditure amount, not including vehicle fuel.
#' @param cm_expenditure_frequent_communication Column name for communications expenditure amount, such as phone airtime, Internet costs, etc.
#' @param cm_expenditure_frequent_other Column name for all other frequent expenditures.
#'
#' @return A data frame with additional columns:
#'
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_total: The total frequent expenditure amount.
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_food_prop: Proportion of food expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_rent_prop: Proportion of rent expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_water_prop: Proportion of water expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_nfi_prop: Proportion of non-food items expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_utilities_prop: Proportion of utilities expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_fuel_prop: Proportion of fuel expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_transportation_prop: Proportion of transportation expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_communication_prop: Proportion of communication expenditure.
#' * cm_expenditure_frequent_other_prop: Proportion of other frequent expenditures.
