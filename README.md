`humind` provides functions to compose usual humanitarian composite
indicators related to IMPACT Multi-Sector Needs Assessments (MSNAs).
Such as:

- Food security indicators (rCSI, LCSI, HHS, FCS).
- JMP ladders.
- Specific indicators related to the MSNI framework.

The package follows the ‚ÄòStep - Composition‚Äô approach of IMPACT R
framework.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of `humind` from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("impact-initiatives-hppu/humind")
```

## New Programmatic Changes in 2025:

- **Protection**: complete ravamp, based on a series of new Tier 1
  indicators related to Protection Needs.

- **SNFI**:

  - Changes to the number of shelter issues and their mapping to the FW
    (from 8 to 11 total issues).
  - Inclusion of one additional indicator to the security of tenure
    dimension: `hlp_eviction_risk.`
  - Hygiene indicator removed from the FDS series - making the total
    number of domestic tasks (and lighting) equal to 4 instead of 5.
  - Optional shelter damages component added.

- **Health**: removal of the WGQs from the framework.

- **WASH**: small changes to incorporate the self-reported variants and
  map them to the JMP classifications.

- **Food Security**: new additional step to analyze the impact of
  livelihood coping strategies on Food Consumption (changes done in
  [impactR4PHU](https://github.com/impact-initiatives/impactR4PHU) and
  reflected in humind).

- **Education**: small changes to indicator naming to reflect ‚Äúdirect
  attack on education‚Äù. Indicator name was `edu_disrupted_occupation`
  and is now called `edu_disrupted_attack.`
