\item cm_expenditure_infrequent_nfi_prop: Proportion of non-food household items expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_infrequent_health_prop: Proportion of health-related expenditures.
\item cm_expenditure_infrequent_education_prop: Proportion of education-related expenditures.
\item cm_expenditure_infrequent_debt_prop: Proportion of debt repayment expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_infrequent_other_prop: Proportion of other infrequent expenditures.
