\value{
A data frame with additional columns:
\itemize{
\item comp_edu_score_disrupted: Score for disrupted education (1-4).
\item comp_edu_score_attendance: Score for attendance and barriers (1-4)
\item comp_edu_score: Total education composite score (max of disrupted and attendance scores).
\item comp_edu_in_need: Binary indicator for being in need of educational assistance.
\item comp_edu_in_acute_need: Binary indicator for being in acute need of educational assistance.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates an education sectoral composite score based on various
education-related indicators. It computes scores for disrupted education and
attendance/barriers, combines them into a total score, and determines if a
household is in need or in acute need of educational assistance.
