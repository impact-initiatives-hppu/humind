\value{
The input data frame with three new composite-score columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{comp_prot_score_prot_needs_2_activities}: weighted sum of activity-related options.
\item \code{comp_prot_score_prot_needs_2_social}: weighted sum of social-related options.
\item \code{comp_prot_score_needs_2}: overall severity (1–4) based on combined score.
}
Plus optional weighted columns (suffix "_w") if \code{.keep_weighted = TRUE}.
